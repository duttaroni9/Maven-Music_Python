Maven Music Data Analysis project has been made based on python coding in Jupyter Notebook with a small part of real time data. At first python libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib & seaborn are imported in Jupyter Notebook. 
Then data gathering has been done by uploading csv & excel files & then some data cleaning has done by converting the data types. 
After that data mining has done by converting Nan values into numeric ‘0’ & then new column has been added to find out customers data who had cancelled their subscription plan irrespective of discount.
